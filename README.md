## Canvas HTML Hack

<https://nowucca.com/2020/07/04/working-around-canvas-limitations.html>

# ideas

matching questions

- different delimiter (-n in answer messes things up)
- add distractors


on calendar month, displays days that are on the same week as a month change (if month ends on monday, still show tues-sat)

file uploads
- image compression?
- scrape html, when image embedded, upload to canvas and add img tag to canvas asset in html before sending image

add grade percentage support in page

wait until week two before colapsing previous month?

better ux around course settings (assignment groups, term for start/end)

display queue of canvas requests

allow multiple courses to be edited concurrently in different browser tabs

have lock date mimic an offset after drag and drop changes due date

make the ux easier to change course pages

schedule planning view? just outline concepts? (maybe some non-canvas scheduled thing that only shows up in planner? like a note, could be de-emphasized in webpage)

holiday schedule
